# @xpert-ai/plugin-analytics-files

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 3afcd71: Use canonical Analytics sources: database connections, immutable Definitions and script Artifacts. Move the five native Providers out of DataSource Types, expose their configuration entries and update Live Dashboard authoring, rendering and sharing. Requires published platform Contracts/SDK 3.26.1 containing the canonical Analytics API; no historical Binding decoder or migration is included.

  Generate Files/REST/MCP/data-xpert Definitions through the Live Dashboard Agent using authorized input discovery, actual-data validation and immutable registration receipts.

  Fix dashboard viewer parsing of canonical Definition and Artifact source references so Agent-generated drafts can be opened, filtered and published.

- f1b700d: Require published SDK and Contracts 3.26.1 and pin development builds to the same release. Use the canonical Analytics, integration permission, Connector scope and connection command contracts instead of local SDK type extensions or platform dependency overlays. Preserve authorization checks for optional host capabilities and existing configuration migration behavior.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 19ac008: Publish the first patch release of Live Dashboard and the analytics providers through the GitHub Actions `release-plugin.yml` trusted publisher after the manual npm 0.1.0 bootstrap release.

  Ship the packages from the xpertai workspace with repository metadata for trusted publishing, published SDK/contracts 3.25.0, and the published Data Analytics renderer. Clean builds resolve the required runtime capabilities without local platform or cross-workspace links.
