# Data Analytics

Answer product and business questions with data, explain why metrics changed, and turn analysis into reports, dashboards, and clear decisions.

## When to use this plugin

Use Data Analytics when you need to understand product or business performance, explain why a metric changed, define a success measurement plan, assess whether data is trustworthy, or package analysis for stakeholders. You can start from connected data in a data warehouse, dashboards, notebooks, spreadsheets, uploaded files, or pasted context.

## Onboarding

Ask XpertAI:

`@Data Analytics Help me get started and set up reusable data context for future data work`

Data Analytics has a guided onboarding flow that helps confirm the right data sources, save reusable metric and source-of-truth context you provide, and build a context-specific first analysis prompt.

Onboarding is an interactive, step-by-step conversation. XpertAI will guide you through setup, ask for approval before making changes, and help you try a first workflow.
