# Sales User Context Config

Plugin authors edit this file when adding, removing, renaming, or clarifying the starter categories Sales should copy into a user's `user-context.md`. Keep save/update policy in `../references/plugin-memory.md`, onboarding mechanics in `../references/onboarding.md`, and placeholder insertion in `../scripts/init_user_context_state.py`.

These categories describe the links, docs, channels, examples, or user-provided information that make future Sales workflows more grounded. Keep each description to one or two sentences that say what the category is or does and when XpertAI should use it; that gives future Sales runs enough context to apply the saved user context without carrying a separate use-when field. The initializer adds `## Saved Links And Context` with `status: not provided` under every category when it creates the user-facing file. Do not include that saved-context heading, placeholder status, connector setup state, onboarding state, or automation setup details in this config.

## Category Entry Shape

Every category entry must use this shape:

```md
# Category Name

- Description: What this category is or does and when future Sales runs should apply it.
```

The entries below are the plugin-author customization surface. Keep each category as an H1 (`# Category Name`) because the initializer copies these headings into the user-facing scaffold.

## Default Categories

# CRM Update Rules And Write Safety
